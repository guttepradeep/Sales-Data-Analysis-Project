# Sales-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, I aim to analyze sales data to uncover valuable insights. By using sales data from April 2019 and combining it with data from other months, I clean the data, explore it, and create visualizations to answer some key questions:

Which month had the highest sales?
Which city had the most sales?
What are the best times to display advertisements to maximize sales?
What products are most frequently sold together?

If you encounter any issues, ensure all necessary packages are installed and the data files are in the correct directory. If the problem persists, searching for specific error messages on Google or forums like Stack Overflow can be helpful.
